# Online Auction System 

Welcome to the **Online Auction System**! This project is a full-stack application that allows users to create, bid on, and manage auctions in real-time. It's built with modern web technologies and designed to offer a robust and interactive user experience. Below is a breakdown of what the system includes and how it works.

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend:
- **Node.js** and **Express.js**: The backbone of the server-side logic.
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose**: For a flexible, schema-based NoSQL database.
- **Socket.IO**: To enable real-time auction updates.
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure, stateless user sessions.

### Frontend:
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and routing.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For sleek, professional UI components.

## Features Implemented (FOR NOW )

### Core Auction Functionality:
1. **Create Auctions**:
   - Users can create auctions with a title, description, starting price, and an end time.
   - Form validation and error handling are included.

2. **Real-Time Bidding**:
   - Users can place bids in real-time.
   - Auctions update instantly using WebSockets.
   - Bid logic ensures no bid is lower than the current price.

3. **Auction Closure**:
   - Auctions automatically close when the end time is reached.
   - A WebSocket event notifies users when an auction ends.

### User Profiles:
- View profile details (username, email, and bids).
- Track past bids and their outcomes.

### Dashboard Enhancements:
- Search and filter auctions by title, category, or price range.
- Track metrics like total bids placed or auctions won.

## Project Setup

### Requirements:
- **Node.js** >= 16.x
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud-based instance)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/online-auction-system.git
   cd online-auction-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5001
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Access the app:
   - **Backend**: `http://localhost:5001`
   - **Frontend**: Integrated into the same project via Next.js.



**Here are some potential future enhancements**
